This is a basic python v3.7 file encoder

how to use :
1) place the file to code in the same folder than the crypter(sryptorcrypt.py) or decrypter( sryptordecrypt.py)
2) run the .py
3) follow the instruction (don't forget the .extension)

4) edit the code between the #==================code commentary to customize the way the encryption work(don't forget to do the reverse in the other file). It just add 1 at first
